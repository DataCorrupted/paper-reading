## Summary
This paper mainly focus on argue against verification, asking researchers not to put verification into program language design main concern and to put more energy on reliability.

The first part compares software-verification in computer science to theorem-proof in math. 
The author argues that what we believed in is not proof but that there is a social process to make a proof correct. 
However, such social process cannot exist in verification because it's not as interesting as proof.

The second part established a new thinking that what's equivalent to mathematic theorem and proof should be specification and programs. 
However, that's still can't make a program's verification believable because theses two tend to affect each other. 

Rather, what we should do be believe in software.

## Pros
- Clear writing and argument
- Interesting examples used to illustrate the author's point

## Cons
- The author failed to picture what would happen if much energy is put into verification.

## Comment
This paper is easy to read and quite interesting.
The authors tried to argue from different perspectives(Math and CS is different, why it is hard, we could've gain more, etc.) and the argument is solid.

Although the author gave clear up sides for not focusing on verification and solid reasons why it's hard. 
The author seldom mentioned why we shouldn't proceed and left the reader wondering the "What if" problem.
