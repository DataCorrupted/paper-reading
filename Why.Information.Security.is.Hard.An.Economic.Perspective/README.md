# [Why.Information.Security.is.Hard.An.Economic.Perspective](https://www.acsac.org/2001/papers/110.pdf)

## Summary

This paper discussed why information security is complex from an economic perspective.
The core argument is that it is hard not only because of technical issues but mainly a lack of incentive.

First, the paper established that information security is based on network economics, i.e., winner takes all model.
This forced developers not to pay much attention to security. Simply put, there is nothing to protect if the business loses.
Then, to protect what the business has already gained, the vendors tend to increase lock-in price, i.e., discourage the user from switching.
This led the vendors to use "a proprietary obscure" system.
Even on the information warfare side, the author recognizes that statically defending is harder than attacking.
What's worse, the "white hat" lacks the motivation to submit a report when a bug is found but rather use it to attack others.

Therefore, the author concludes that information security is "a much deeper and more political problem" rather than a commonly perceived "technical" issue.
The author calls engineers, economists, and lawyers to work hand in hand to deal with this problem.
