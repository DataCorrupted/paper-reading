# [How.to.Read.a.Paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf)

## Summary

This paper introduces the method on how to read a paper, i.e., the three-pass method (Sec 2).
Based on that method, the authors introduce how to use the three-pass method to do a survey.

Each pass in the three passes tries to answer some questions about the project the paper is presenting, from top to bottom:

- 1st pass: answer 5 "C." Personally, I believe Correctness and Contribution are more important.
    - Category
    - Context: What are related papers?
    - Correctness: Is the assumption correct?
    - Contribution: What is achieved?
    - Clarity: Is this paper well written?

- 2nd pass: Understand the details and supporting proves. Ideally, after this pass, you can now present a paper. But if not, move on.
- 3rd pass: Try to re-invent the wheel. Given the authors' assumptions, how would you approach this problem, and if there is a difference, you can then appreciate their pros and cons.
