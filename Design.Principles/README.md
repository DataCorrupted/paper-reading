# Chp 14. of Computer Security: Design Principles

## Summary 

This chapter summarized 8 design principles of security systems, which includes:

- Principle of Least Privile, i.e. an entity should be granted minimal priviliage to do its job.
- Principle of Fail-Safe Defaults, i.e. the system should deny an access unless it is explicitly given privilages to do so.
- Principle of Economy of Mechanism, i.e. the system should be as simple as possible, pretty much like Occam's razor.
- Principle of Complete Meditation, i.e. all access should be checked and cached results shouldn't be trusted.
- Principle of Open Design, i.e. do not solely rely on "security through obscurit", as any product can be reverse engineered.
- Minimize Secrets, allow as little secrets as possible
- Principle of Separation of Privilege, i.e. the system shouldn't grant permission based on one condition.
- Principle of Least Common Mechanism. Shared resources can be used to communicate, but can also be an attack surface.
- Principle of Least Astonishment. This is the only principle concerning humans. The users should understand the design so they use it properly.
