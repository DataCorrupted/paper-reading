## Summary

This paper focus on how to evaluate vulnerability finding tools. 
They spot the hardship where bugs are found and patched and become harder and harder to find.
On the other hand, injected bugs are not feasible in practise.
Thus they introduced LAVA, an automated tool to inject bugs.

While injecting bugs, LAVA does taint tracking and introduced some new definitions. 

- DUA: Dead Uncomplicated and Available data.
- TCN: Taint Compute Number
- LIV: Liveness

LAVA works in the following way:

- Find DUA
- Find attack points based on the DUA
- Add code to the attack point to attack it.

In the experiment they tried to inject bugs to see if LAVA works. 
The result showed that they are able to inject bugs into programs.

## Pros

- Injected exploitable bugs to the program to help evaluate bug finding tools
