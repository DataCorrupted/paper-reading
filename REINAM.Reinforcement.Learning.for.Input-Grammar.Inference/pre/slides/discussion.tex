	\begin{itemize}
		\item RL's effective seems limited (Table 1 and Figure 5).
		\item Is PCFG stateful? In context free grammar, a generation rule's correctness is not affected by current state, then why policy gradient?
		\item Current reward will lower correct grammar's probability if some other wrong production rule is used.
